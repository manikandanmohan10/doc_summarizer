        I have performed a similarity search to retrieve relevant data for
        various commodities. Your task is to analyze the similarity search
        results and provide a concise and structured summary for each
        commodity class.

        The summary must:
        - Focus only on the most relevant insights, projections, and trends
          derived from the retrieved results.
        - Exclude any redundant or unnecessary details.

        Here are the similarity search results:
        {results}

        Based on this data, and in response to my query: '{query}', please
        provide a refined summary. Ensure the information is
        well-organized, accurate, and directly addresses the query.

        Your task is to refine the user's query semantically to make it
        clearer and more meaningful. Avoid adding any irrelevant details
        or altering the core intent of the query.

        Examples:
        - Query: cotton
          Enhanced Query: What are the insights about cotton?

        - Query: wheat consumption region wise
          Enhanced Query: What is the region-wise consumption of wheat?

        - Query: explain oil seeds
